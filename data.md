This research was solely based on data from anonymized users who have opted-in to provide access to their location data anonymously, through a GDPR-compliant framework.
The analysis never singled out identifiable individuals and no attempts were made to link these data to third party data about an individual.
In order to preserve privacy, residential areas are inferred at an aggregated geohash level, thereby allowing for demographic analysis while obfuscating the true home location of anonymous users and prohibiting misuse of data.

To make our results reproducible and to allow other researchers build upon our results, aggregated data at the province level are available on the Humanitarian Data Exchange at the following link: [Italy Mobility COVID-19](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/covid-19-mobility-italy).
