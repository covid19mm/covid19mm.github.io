These pages are used to host on-going project work done through a Data Collaborative between the [ISI Foundation](https://www.isi.it) and [Cuebiq Inc](https://www.cuebiq.com).

The research project analyses anonymized location data to understand the effect of mobility restrictions and behavioral changes on the current international COVID-19 outbreak.

The aggregated mobility data are publicly available as described [here](https://covid19mm.github.io/data.html).

If you find the data helpful or you use the data for your research, please cite our work:
