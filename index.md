These pages are used to host on-going project work done through a Data Collaborative between the [ISI Foundation](https://www.isi.it) and [Cuebiq Inc](https://www.cuebiq.com).

The research project analyses anonymized location data to understand the effect of mobility restrictions and behavioral changes on the current international COVID-19 outbreak.

Our initial results are reported on medRxiv as a preprint:
